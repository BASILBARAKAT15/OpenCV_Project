  A program that read a video stream from your computerâ€™s camera. 
Allow the user to choose one of the following display modes:  
1. Edge detection: Apply any suitable edge detection technique. 
2. Grayscale Quantization: Reduce the grayscale levels to a user-defined 
number. 
3. Contrast enhancement: Enhance contrast by applying histogram 
equalization frame-by-frame. Test your implementation by changing the 
brightness of your environment and observe how the processed video 
responds. 
4. Soft and polished appearance: Apply a blurring filter to smooth the 
video frames. This helps reduce noise and minor facial imperfections, 
resulting in a soft and polished appearance. 
5. Cartoon Filter: Apply creative effects like a cartoon-style filter for fun 
and practice. Hint: This may involve converting frames to grayscale, 
applying smoothing, detecting edges, and performing quantization.
